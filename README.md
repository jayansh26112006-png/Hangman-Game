# Hangman-Game
The user's C code implements a classic Hangman game where the objective is to guess the hidden word, "JAYANSH", within six attempts, or "lives." The program initializes a display array with hyphens to hide the word and enters a loop that continues until the player either runs out of lives or successfully guesses the entire word. In each turn, the player is prompted for a letter, which is converted to uppercase; the program then checks if this letter exists in the secret word, revealing all occurrences in the display if it's a correct guess, or decrementing a life if it's incorrect. The loop constantly updates the player on the state of the word and their remaining lives, terminating the game with a win message upon full revelation of the word, or a loss message revealing the secret word if all lives are exhausted.
